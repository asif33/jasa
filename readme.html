<p>
The Auction Simulator API allows researchers in experimental economics to write
high-performance trading simulations using a number of different auction
protocols. The software also provides base classes for implementing simple
adaptive trading agents.
</p>

<p>
The system is based on the 4-heap algorithm, described in the paper

<p>
"Flexible Double Auctions for Electronic Commerce: Theory and Implementation"
by Wurman, Walsh amnd Wellman 1998.
</p>

<p>
The system implements various experiments, agents and learning agents described elsewhere in the experimental economics literature.  The documentation provides citation details where appropriate.

<h2>
Required libraries
</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a> (Optional) required for running the unit tests</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/plus/ec/ecj/">ECJ</a> (Optional) Required for running the genetic-programming experiments</a>
<p>

<h2>
Examples
</h2>

<p>The following examples demonstrate the use of the auction simulator:</p>

<p><code>
uk.ac.liv.auction.DCSimulation<br>
uk.ac.liv.auction.MarketSimulation<br>
uk.ac.liv.auction.SupplyRingSimulation<br>
</p></code>

<p>Each of these examples can be run as an independent application. The file <a href="auction.params">auction.params</a> can be used to initialise ECJ to run the genetic programming experiments.
