<p>
The Auction Simulator API allows researchers in experimental economics to write
high-performance trading simulations using a number of different auction
protocols. The software also provides base classes for implementing simple
adaptive trading agents.
</p>

<p>
The system is based on the 4-heap algorithm, described in the paper

<p>
"Flexible Double Auctions for Electronic Commerce: Theory and Implementation"
by Wurman, Walsh amnd Wellman 1998.
</p>

<p>
The system implements various experiments, agents and learning agents described elsewhere in the experimental economics literature.  The documentation provides citation details where appropriate.
</p>

<p>
The system currently supports parameterisable auctioneer classes for the following auction types:
</p>

<li>Multi-Unit Continuous Double Auction</li>
<li>Multi-Unit Ascending Auction</li>

<p>
The system is designed so that introducing new classes of auctioneers should be relatively straightforward.

<h2>
Downloading
</h2>

<p>
The latest release of JASA can be downloaded from the JASA <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/jasa">summary page</a>.
</p>

<h2>
Documentation
</h2>
<p>
The javadoc documentation can be found <a href="doc/index.html">here</a>.
</p>

<h2>
Required libraries
</h2>

<p>
<a href="http://poolit.sourceforge.net/">PooliT</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/projects/plus/ec/ecj/">ECJ</a>
<p>

<p>
<a href="http://jade.cselt.it/">JADE</a> (Optional) required for running 
simulations under the JADE agent platform</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.junit.org">JUnit</a> (Optional) required for running 
the unit tests</a>
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://alphaworks.ibm.com/tech/Skij">Skij</a> (Optional) required for manipulating koza trees as scheme s-expressions
</p>

<p>
Optional libraries are required for compilation, but are not required for running JASA if the indicated functionality is not being used.
<p>

<h2>
Running
</h2>

Ensure that all required libraries, including the <code>jasa.jar</code> file, are present in your <code>CLASSPATH</code> environment variable, and then run the class <code>uk.ac.liv.auction.MarketSimulation</code>, giving the name of a parameter file as the first argument.

<h2>
Examples
</h2>

<p>
The <code>examples/</code> directory contains several parameter files 
for different example experiments.  
These can be run using the <code>uk.ac.liv.auction.MarketSimulation</code> 
application, e.g.
<p>
<code>
java uk.ac.liv.auction.MarketSimulation examples/example1.params
</code>
</p>

<h2>
Compiling
</h2>

<p>
JASA ships with a <code>build.xml</code> file that can be used with 
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/index.html">Apache Ant</a> to build the
project.  The default settings in <code>build.xml</code> expect to find
the various third-party class libraries used by JASA in the directory
</code>/usr/local/java/lib</code>, however alternative locations can be
specified by creating a file <code>build.ant.properties</code>.
