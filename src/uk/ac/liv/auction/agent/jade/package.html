	A package to allow JASA experiments to be run under the JADE agent platform.  This package is highly experimentally and was originally written as a proof-of-concept to show how adaptors and proxies could be used to run arbitrary simulations written
in JAVA under the JADE platform.  This package will be removed from future
releases unless volunteers come forward to maintain the package.
