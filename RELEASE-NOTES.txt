  Change log for JASA 0.36 - 9th January 2009
  
Changes since release 0.35:
  
New features
------------

A new package for simulation supply chains (uk.ac.liv.supplychain) 
has been contributed by  Thierry Moyaux (Thierry.Moyaux@insa-lyon.fr ).

Libraries
---------

Upgraded to the following versions of third-party libraries:

Repast: version 3.1
ECJ: version 18
GNU Trove: version 2.0.4
JFreeChart: version 1.0.12

JASA now links with the Apache commons math library version 1.2.

Refactoring
-----------

The class uk.ac.liv.util.CummulativeDistribution has been renamed 
to uk.ac.liv.util.SummaryStats and is now a wrapper for the class
SummaryStatistics from the apache commons-math package.

The distribution now contains Eclipse .project and .classpath files,
allowing the project archive to be imported into directly into the 
Eclipse IDE as an Eclipse project. 

The lib/ directory now only contains binary .jar files, and these have
been added to the CVS tree.
